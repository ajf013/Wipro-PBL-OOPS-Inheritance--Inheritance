 A HighSchool application has two classes: the Person superclass and the Student subclass. Using inheritance, in this lab you will create two new classes, Teacher and CollegeStudent. A Teacher will be like Person but will have additional properties such as salary (the amount the teacher earns) and subject (e.g. “Computer Science”, “Chemistry”,  “English”, “Other”). The CollegeStudent class will extend the Student class by adding a year (current level in college) and major (e.g. “Electrical Engineering”, “Communications”, “Undeclared”).
